# ▼△▼△▼ Setup

**Create a folder for all your in-class exercises.**

Organize your files with a consistent folder structure *that's the same for all your projects*. The easiest way to do this is to create a "workflow template" — a set of mostly empty folders that you copy and rename every time you start a new project.

1. Create a folder for this class

2. **Download the [Video Workflow Template zip file](../../resources/videoWorkFlowTemplate.zip) and place it in your class folder**


3. Unzip and rename the VideoWorkFlowTemplate folder "premiereInClassExercise"
  * Double-click the file to unzip on a Mac
  * Check out [this tutorial](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-open-a-mac-zip-file-in-windows) if you are having trouble unzipping it in Windows

4. Download the sample footage from the class google drive Assets folder, and add it to the Source Media > Video > fromInternet folder

Your folder structure should look like this: <br>
![this](../../resources/videoWorkflowTemplatePic.png)
<br>
<br>

***Tip:***

*When you import footage from you camera, it will probably have meaningless numbered names for the files. You should rename them something that indicates what the footage is. There are ways to rename files in batches with sequential prefixes.*

*For example:*

X679976.mp4
X679977.mp4
X679978.mp4

*magically transforms into:*

eveningShoot_Sam_00.mp4
eveningShoot_Sam_01.mp4
eveningShoot_Sam_02.mp4

* This footage is now available for use in your project!

#### ▼ Save Your Project
* If you haven't already, save your project now.
* An asterisk next to the file name means there are unsaved changes

#### ▼ View and Organize Footage

* Double click on footage and it will show in the Source Monitor
* In the Project tab, rename and organize footage as desired- keep organized according to type of shot

#### ▼ Isolate clip within Footage

![Select Clip](assets/6_Premiere_SelectFtg.png)

* You probably won't be using your entire clip, so you need to isolate the footage you want to edit
* Click in your Source Monitor panel and preview footage
  * Navigate footage with play / space bar
  * OR! use j k and l to go backwards and forwards. If you double click on one it will play twice as fast
* (You can bookmark places in your clip by using the ‘Marker’ arrows or by hitting m)
* To set your **in-point** - where you want your clip to begin - press ‘I’, or use the ‘Mark In’ tool ‘{‘
* To set your **out-point** - where you want your clip to end - press ‘O’ or use the ‘Mark Out’ tool ‘}’

* Next, click on the **insert or overwrite icons** in the Source Panel
* Check out the difference between insert and overwrite:
  - Insert will scoot the existing footage over
  - Overwrite will plop it on top

#### ▼ View Sequence in Program Monitor

# ▼△▼△▼ EXPORTING

### ▼ Tip on selecting a region for export

When you export your sequence, Premiere will automatically export your entire timeline. If you have a clip set aside after the end of your sequence, Premiere will export that too.

![Premiere default export region](assets/Premiere_exporting_00_1.png)

<br>

To get around this, you will need to activate the work area bar.


![Activate work area](assets/Premiere_exporting_00_2.png)

<br>
Now that you can see the grey work area bar, you can select just the region of your sequence you want to export.

![Set work area](assets/Premiere_exporting_01.png)
